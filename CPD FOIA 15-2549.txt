SUBJECT: Quote / Purchase of Maintenance program from PEN-Link.

Attached to this report you will find a quote from PEN—Link,
Ltd. of Lincoln Nebraska. This quote is to purchase two
maintenance programs from PEN-Link for the period of 01 December
2014 to 30 November 2015. The first program is for the
collection of voice and data evidence and the second program is
to ensure that the Bureau's hardware has the latest up to date
software. These maintenance programs are necessary for the
Bureau of Organized Crimes to maintain PEN register
investigations and Title III investigations.

This service is covert in nature and knowledge of its existence
should be kept within the Bureau of Organized Crime. The cost
for these agreements is $137,171.67. Because this service will
be used for narcotics related and other investigations it is
recommended that 1505 funds and 1505ML fu ds in equal amounts be
used to pay these services.
