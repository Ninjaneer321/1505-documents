Your request was reviewed by the undersigned in consultation with personnel from the Bureau of Organized Crime.
The enclosed records were located by above personnel as responsive to your request and furnished to the
undersigned. The Bureau of Organized Crime furnished to the undersigned ten (10) documents specifying the
purchase with the above listed checks. Upon review, it has been determined that copies of these records can be
released with certain information redacted. The redacted information is exempt from disclosure under the
following provisions of the Illinois Freedom of information Act;

5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this
Act, a State or federal law or a court order.

Information withheld under §7(1)(b) is officers‘ signatures.

5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) "Private information" means unique identifiers, including a person's
social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number,
biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes,
medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.
Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as
othenlvise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any
person.

5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(c) Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in
writing by the individual subjects of the information. "Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" means
the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in
which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.
The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not
be considered an invasion of personal privacy.

The names of private individuals were properly redacted pursuant to Section 7(1)(c).

5 ILCS 140/7 (1)(d) Records in the possession of any public body created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law
enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would:

(v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used
and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection,
observation or investigation of incidents of or misconduct, and disclosure would result
in demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request.

(vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person;

In addition, covert accounts information, make and model of vehicles assigned to Police Officers who work in
covert capacity have been redacted. Revealing such information can clearly jeopardize future undercover
operations and endanger the lives of such officers. As such, this information has been properly redacted
pursuant to §7(1)(d)(v) and (d)(vi).

If I can be of further assistance, you may contact me at (312) 745-5308, or by mail at the following address:
