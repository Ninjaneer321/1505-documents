Re: NOTICE OF RESPONSE

ORIGINAL REQUEST DATE: February 9, 2015
NARROWED REQUEST DATE: February 27, 2015
FOIA FILE NO.: 15-0599

Dear Mr. Martinez:

The Chicago Police Department is in receipt of your Z27/2015 email which seeks to narrow the scope of item
#9 from your original Z9/2015 FOIA request. The relevant portion of your original request sought access to
"records showing every transaction paid for with 1505/1505ML funds." On 2/25 you were informed that this part
of your request was burdensome due to the fact that 1) there have been thousands of individual transactions
which have been "paid with" 1505/1505ML funds and 2) that for each of these purchased a variety of classes
of records may exist which could be considered to be responsive to this broadly worded request.

In your "narrowed" FOIA request, you state that you wish to limit the scope of this request to include
"records showing every transaction paid for with 1505/1505ML funds "for "purchases" which 1) exceeded
$5,000 and 2) were made in the last five years. This narrowed request was reviewed by the undersigned as
well as the Bureau of Organized Crime (BOC). Upon review, it was determined that, even as revised, this
request remains "unduly burdensome" for the Department to comply with under 5 ILCS 140/3(g). According to
BOC there have been more than 400 "purchases" in excess of $5,000 which were made with 1505/1505ML
funds 2010—present. As with your original request, for each of these purchases there exists a variety of
potentially responsive records. In total, thousands of pages of individual records exist which could be
considered to be "record[s] showing [these 400+] transaction[s] paid." The efforts required to identify, collect,
review, and redact such a voluminous number of records would place a significant and undue burden on
Department personnel and resources and, as such, would be prohibited by the Act. However, in a good faith
effort to assist you, we are providing you with a ledger which list the payment type, date, transaction number,
and dollar amount for all "purchases" made with 1505/1505ML funds between 2010 and the present. We hope
that this record satisfies this portion of your request. If not, however, you are again invited to re-submit a
narrowed request. If you would like assistance in further narrowing your request, please contact me and I will
assist you. Otherwise, as explained above, we will be unable to respond to this request as it is currently
written.

If you agree to narrow your request, you must submit a revised written request to my attention. CPD will take
no further action or send you any further correspondence unless and until your current request is narrowed in
writing.

Emergency and TTY: 9-1-1 - Non Emergency and TTY: (within city limits) 3-1-1 - Non Emergency and TTY: (outside city limits) (312) 746-6000

In the event that we do not receive a narrowed request and your current FOIA request is therefore denied, you
will have a right of review by the Illinois Attorney General's Public Access Counselor. You can file your
Request for Review with the PAC by writing to:

Public Access Counselor
Office of the Attorney General
500 S. 2”“ Street

Springfield, IL 62706

You will also have the right to seek judicial review of a denial by filing a lawsuit in the State circuit court per
5 ILCS 140/11.

If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

P.O. Jack Kenter
Freedom of Information Officer
Department of Police
