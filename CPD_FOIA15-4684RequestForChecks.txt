RE: NOTICE OF RESPONSE TO FOIA REQUEST
REQUEST DATE: August 16, 2015
FOIA FILE NO.: 15-4684

Dear Mr. Martinez:
The Chicago Police Department is in receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for:

"...the following public records, regardless of physical form

or characteristics, under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act the

following records about the following 1505 or 1505ML expenses by their
date and Check number. We are seeking documents sufficient to show what
the following checks where used to purchase, any solicitation or bidding
that went into the check, emails about the funding, and any receipt for

the funding.

Check #17698 dated 10/24/2014 for the amount $21,926.44
Check #17427 dated 05/08/2014 for the amount $59,670.00
Check #17755 dated 12/02/2014 for the amount $24,238.92
Check #17795 dated 01/06/2015 for the amount $48,012.00

Additionally we are requesting the expenditures for the following checks
in the amount of $8,500.00 which seems to be a reoccurring payment but it
is unclear what the expenditures are. The checks are:

#17732 dated 1 1/20/2014,
#17678 dated 10/15/2014,
#17635 dated 09/18/2014,
#17616 dated 09/03/2014,
#17559 dated 07/23/2014,
#17541 dated 07/09/2014,
#17792 dated 01/06/2015,
#17820 dated 01/22/2015,
#17517 dated 06/18/2014, and
#17451 dated 05/20/2014"

Pursuant to our written communication on November 3rd and November 18th, this is the CPD response to the

Emergency and TTY: 9-1-1 - Non Emergency and TTY: (within city limits) 3-1-1 - Non Emergency and TTY: (outside city limits) (312) 746-6000
E-mail: police@cityofchicago.org - Website: www.cityofcl1icago.org/police

extension that was granted. Your request was reviewed by the undersigned as well as the Bureau of
Organized Crime. Upon review, it was determined that your request seeks documents sufficient to show what
the above listed checks were used to purchase. The Bureau of Organized Crime furnished the attached ten
responsive documents, which specify what was purchased with the above listed checks. These fourteen (14)
documents are the only responsive records the Chicago Police Department has to your request.

Upon review of these documents, it was determined that the Chicago Police Department will provide you with
these records, with certain information redacted under the Freedom of Information Act.

First, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, employee numbers, home or personal telephone
numbers and signatures are exempt and have been redacted. The redacted information is exempt from
disclosure under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act, which exempts "private information,
unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or court order.” “Private
information” is defined in section 2(c-5) as “unique identifiers, including a person’s social security number,
driver’s license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information,
passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email

addresses.” 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5). Therefore, the Chicago Police Department properly redacted signatures from
the attached records.

In addition, the names and other information that could be used to identify covert operations have been
redacted. Revealing such information can clearly jeopardize future undercover operations and endanger the lives
of law enforcement officers. Therefore, information regarding covert operations is exempt from disclosure pursuant
to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1 )(d) which states "records in the possession of any public body created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement
purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would:

(v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known
or disclose internal documents of a correctional agencies related to detection, observation or
investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure could result in demonstrable harm
to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request; and/or

(vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person."

Therefore, the Chicago Police Department has properly redacted the names of covert officers, covert programs
and account numbers. -

Your copies of the redacted records are attached.
If I can be of further assistance, you may contact me at (312) 745-5308, or by mail at the following address:

SUBJECT: Quote / Purchase of three XFM Unit Servers.

Attached to this report you will find a quote from Soliaht£bVE
Consulting of Chicago Illinois. This quote is for three XFM3—0408
4GB Windows, 8GB Database storage devices. These devices are
servers and will be used to administer and back up aliof the
Bureau of Organized Crimes Databases. Included in this quote is a
required CPU upgrade, and a maintenance contract for one year which
includes hardware replacement and support. This equipment is
required to replace the current server which is nearing the end of
its useful life. The current server is over five years old and will
not support the web basing features in the newly developed databases
for the Bureau of Organized Crimes. The new server includes a back
up system which will guarantee the safe keeping of all of the
Bureaus data. The servers are configured as fail over (redundancy)
where if one of the servers fails the system will continue to
function with no interruption or data loss to the end users. In

addition, there will be no interruption to the end user during
system back ups.

This equipment is covert in nature and knowledge of its existence
should be kept within the Bureau of Organized Crime. The cost for
equipment is $59,670.00. Because this equipment will be used for
both narcotics related investigations and other investigations it is

recommended that 1505 funds and 1505ML funds in equal am unts be
used to pay this equipment.
