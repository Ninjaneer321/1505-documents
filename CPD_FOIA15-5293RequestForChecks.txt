the purchase with the above listed checks. Upon review, it has been determined that copies of these records
can be released with certain information redacted. The redacted information is exempt from disclosure under
the following provisions of the Illinois Freedom of information Act;

5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this
Act, a State or federal law or a court order.

5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) "Private information" means unique identifiers, including a
person's social security number, driver's license number, employee identification

without possibility of attribution to any person.

5 ILCS 140/7 (1 )(c) Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would

writing by the individual subjects of the information. "Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" means
the disclosure of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in
which the subject's right to privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information.
The disclosure of information that bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not
be considered an invasion of personal privacy.

5|LCS 140/7 (1)(d)(v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally
used and known or disclose internal documents of correctional agencies related to detection,
observation or investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure would result in
demonstrable harm to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request;

information withheld under §7(1)(b) and §7(1)(c) is account names/numbers and officers‘ signatures. In
addition, information withheld under §7(1)(d)(v) is specific hardware that is utilized for covert operations,
revealing such information can clearly jeopardize the Department's future undercover operations.
