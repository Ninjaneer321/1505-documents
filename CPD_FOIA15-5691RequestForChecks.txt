Dear Dr. Helsby:

Garry F. McCarthy
Superintendent. of Police

The Chicago Police Department is in receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. In your

’’I am seeking the following public records, regardless of physical form or characteristics, under the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1 to 11) about the following 1505 or 1505ML expenses
by their date and check number. I am seeking documents sufficient to show what the following checks

and any receipt for the funding.

Check #17638 dated 09/18/2014 for the amount $18272.33
Check #17643 dated 09/24/2014 for the amount $581 1.5
Check #17668 dated 10/06/2014 for the amount $15182. 78
Check #17681 dated 10/20/2014 for the amount $5886.0
Check #17688 dated 10/21/2014 for the amount $18493.96

Check #17767 dated 12/17/2014 for the amount $13994.47"

Your request was reviewed by the undersigned in consultation with personnel from the Bureau of Organized
Crime. The enclosed records were located by above personnel as responsive to your request and furnished to
the undersigned. The Bureau of Organized Crime furnished to the undersigned (11) eleven documents
specifying the purchase with the above listed checks. Upon review, it has been determined that copies of these
records can be released with certain information redacted. The redacted information which includes signatures,
account numbers and home addresses, is exempt from disclosure under the following provisions of the Illinois

Freedom of Information Act;

5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b) Private information, unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a

State or federal law or a court order.

5 ILCS 140/2(c-5) "Private information" means unique identifiers, including a person's
social security number, driver's license number, employee identification number,

Emergency and TTY: 9-1-I - Non Emergency and TTY: (within city limits) 3-I-I - Non Emergency and TTY: (outside city limits) (312) 746-6000

E-mail: police@cityofchicago.org - Website: www.cityofchicago.org/police

biometric identifiers, personal financial information, passwords or other access codes,
medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email addresses.
Private information also includes home address and personal license plates, except as
otherwise provided by law or when compiled without possibility of attribution to any
person.

5 ILCS 140/7(1)(c) Personal information contained within public records, the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, unless the disclosure is consented to in writing
by the individual subjects of the information. "Unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" means the disclosure
of information that is highly personal or objectionable to a reasonable person and in which the subject's right to
privacy outweighs any legitimate public interest in obtaining the information. The disclosure of information that

bears on the public duties of public employees and officials shall not be considered an invasion of personal
privacy.

Furthermore, information withheld under §7(1)(b) and §7(1)(c) is account names/numbers and officers’
signatures.
