Re: NOTICE OF RESPONSE TO FOIA REQUEST
REQUEST DATE: November 4, 2015
FOIA FILE NO.: 15-6708

Dear Mr. Morisy:
The Chicago Police Department is in receipt of your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for:

Documents sufficient to show what the following checks were used to purchase, any solicitation or bidding that
went into the check, emails about the funding, and any receipt for the funding.

Check #14425 dated 01/04/2010 for the amount $9423.80;
Check #14428 dated 01/05/2010 for the amount $6297.69;
Check #14443 dated 01/06/2010 for the amount $6292.58;
Check #14445 dated 01/06/2010 for the amount $128960. 15; and
Check #14452 dated 01/12/2010 for the amount $34039. 74.

On November 23, 2015, CPD sought a timely five day extension pursuant to 5 ILCS 140/3(e), up to and
including December 1, 2015 to respond to your FOIA request. CPD is now timely responding to your request.

You request was reviewed by the undersigned as well as the Bureau of Organized Crime. Upon review, it was
determined that your request seeks documents sufficient to show what the above listed checks were used to
purchase. The Bureau of Organized Crime furnished the attached ten responsive documents, which specify
what was purchased with the above listed checks. These ten documents are the only responsive records the
Chicago Police Department has to your request.

Upon review of these documents, it was determined that the Chicago Police Department will provide you with
these records, with certain information redacted under the Freedom of Information Act.

First, social security numbers, driver's license numbers, employee numbers, home or personal telephone
numbers and signatures are exempt and have been redacted. The redacted information is exempt from
disclosure under 5 ILCS 140/7(1)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act, which exempts "private information,
unless disclosure is required by another provision of this Act, a State or federal law or court order.” “Private
information” is defined in section 2(c—5) as “unique identifiers, including a person's social security number,
driver’s license number, employee identification number, biometric identifiers, personal financial information,
passwords or other access codes, medical records, home or personal telephone numbers, and personal email
addresses.” 5 ILCS 140/2(c-5). Therefore, the Chicago Police Department properly redacted signatures from
the attached records.

Emergency and TTY: 9-1-1 - Non Emergency and TTY: (within city limits) 3- I -I - Non Emergency and TTY: (outside city limits) (3I2) 746-6000
E-mail: police@cityofcl1icngo.org - Website: www.cityofcl1icago.o1‘g/police

 

In addition, the names and other information that could be used to identify covert operations have been
redacted. Revealing such information can clearly jeopardize future undercover operations and endanger the lives
of law enforcement officers. Therefore, information regarding covert operations is exempt from disclosure pursuant
to 5 ILCS 140/7 (1 )(d) which states "records in the possession of any public body created in the course of
administrative enforcement proceedings, and any law enforcement or correctional agency for law enforcement
purposes, but only to the extent that disclosure would:

(v) disclose unique or specialized investigative techniques other than those generally used and known
or disclose internal documents of a correctional agencies related to detection, observation or
investigation of incidents of crime or misconduct, and disclosure could result in demonstrable harm
to the agency or public body that is the recipient of the request; and/or

(vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel or any other person."

Therefore, the Chicago Police Department has properly redacted the names of covert officers, covert programs
and account numbers.

Your copies of the redacted records are attached.
It you need any further assistance you may contact the undersigned at 312-745-5308 or the following address:
