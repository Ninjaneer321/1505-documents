N]. Cellebrltc USA has been selling direct for the past 11 years and we do not sell to any first
source, GSA or other resellers.

With over 55 carriers in the U.S. and over 100 worldwide we are the exclusive provider of mobile
synchronization systems for Verizon Wireless, AT&'I', Sprint/Nextel, T-Mobile, Metro PCS,
Western Wireless, US Cellular, Cricket Communications as well as thousands of privately held
cellular retailers.

The Cellebritse UFED System is the only hand-held, cellular exploitation device worldwide that
requires no PC or associated phone drivers. The UFED system will quickly extract phoneboolc,
pictures, videos, SMS messages, calls histories, ESN/IMEI information, and deleted SMS/call
histories off the SIM/ USIM for rapid analysis. Celiebritae supports all the major technologies
(TDMA, CDMA, GSM, IDEN) including , Sxnartphone operating systems and PDAS (Apple
iPhone, Blackberry, Google Android, Microsoft Mobile, Palm and Symbian) for over 95% of all
handset models worldwide.

Cello-bn'te‘s competitive advantage is its extraction speed, innritive user interface that is operable

with little to no training. With our exclusive nationwide carrier agreements we are receiving pre-

produclion handsets and source codes from the cell phone manufacturers 6 months prior to retail
launch which is a major advantage for research and development.

With over 90,000 units sold worldwide and hundreds of thousands of end-users, our products
have been deployed reliably and effectively throughout the world for both commercial data
synchronization and forensic data analysis. Our forensic customers include the Department of
Defense," Federal Government, intelligence Organizations, Military, and Law Enforcement

Divisions.

Dear Zelda, .  , _ __

On April 16, 2012 I forwarded an Asset Forfeiture Request for a Universal Forensic Extraction Device — Cellebrite (sole
source) for narcotics investigations, in the amount of $8,438.98. You asked Alexis for additional information on this

request.

Alexis conducted an internet search and this is the only extraction device that comes up. Also in speaking with our
Verizon representative, it is the only unit the major phone companies use to extract data from cell phones.

In addition Alexis talked to Officer Maurice Cernick and he indicated to her that the information off this device is
admissible in Court.

Please review this Request at your earliest convenience and advise our office if it is approved.
